Check out our live application at [Crypto Piggy Bank](https://crypto-piggy.vercel.app/)! Experience the future of savings today!

## Overview
Welcome to the **Crypto Piggy Bank** project! This innovative application allows users to securely deposit ETH with a customizable lock time, ensuring that your funds remain untouched until you're ready to access them. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this project combines the power of smart contracts with a sleek, user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Time-Locked Savings**: Deposit ETH and set a lock duration to keep your savings secure.
- **Withdraw with Confidence**: Access your funds only after the specified unlock time has passed.
- **View Deposit Details**: Easily check your deposit amount and unlock time.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a modern and responsive user interface built with TailwindCSS.
- **Web3 Integration**: Seamlessly connect with MetaMask for effortless wallet interactions.

## Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Hardhat Deployment Setup
- Use `hardhat.config.js` to connect to the Sepolia Testnet via Alchemy.
- Store sensitive information such as the Alchemy API key and wallet private key in a `.env` file.
- Compile and deploy the smart contract to Sepolia.
- Log the deployed contract address for future reference.

### Smart Contract Verification
- Verify the contract on Sepolia Etherscan using Hardhat plugins.
- Ensure the contract is publicly viewable for transparency.

### Next.js Frontend
- Create a React app using Next.js.
- Utilize `ethers.js` to interact with the smart contract.
- Implement the following functions:
  - **Deposit ETH**: Allow users to set a lock time for their deposits.
  - **Withdraw ETH**: Ensure users can only withdraw after the unlock time.
  - **View Deposit Details**: Display the amount deposited and the unlock time.
- Style the application using TailwindCSS for a sleek look.

### Web3 Integration
- Enable MetaMask connection for user authentication.
- Fetch and display the user's wallet balance.
- Provide real-time updates on contract interactions.

### Testing & Optimization
- Use Sepolia ETH from a faucet for testing purposes.
- Handle edge cases such as zero deposits and early withdrawals.
- Optimize gas usage for efficient transactions.

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the smart contract and confirm its address on Sepolia.
2. Generate a user-friendly Next.js UI to interact with the contract.
3. Optimize the application and prepare it for a portfolio showcase.

## üîó Smart Contract Repository

For those interested in the underlying technology that powers the **Crypto Piggy Bank**, we invite you to explore our smart contract repository: [ETH-Piggy-Bank-contract](https://github.com/Eiad/ETH-Piggy-Bank-contract).

### üõ†Ô∏è What's Inside?

The smart contract is the backbone of our application, built using Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Here's a brief overview of its key features:

- **Time-Locked Deposits**: Users can deposit ETH with a customizable lock time, ensuring that their funds remain secure and inaccessible until the specified duration has elapsed. This feature is crucial for promoting disciplined savings.

- **Secure Withdrawals**: The contract enforces strict rules around withdrawals, allowing users to access their funds only after the unlock time has passed. This mechanism is designed to prevent premature withdrawals, safeguarding users' savings.

- **Event Logging**: Every deposit and withdrawal action is logged on the blockchain, providing transparency and traceability. Users can verify their transactions on Etherscan, ensuring complete trust in the system.

- **Gas Efficiency**: The contract is optimized for gas usage, making transactions cost-effective for users. This is particularly important in the Ethereum ecosystem, where gas fees can fluctuate significantly.

- **Robust Error Handling**: The contract includes comprehensive error handling to manage edge cases, such as attempts to withdraw funds before the unlock time or deposits without sending ETH.

By leveraging the power of smart contracts, the **Crypto Piggy Bank** not only offers a user-friendly interface but also ensures that your savings are managed securely and transparently. Dive into the code and see how we've harnessed blockchain technology to revolutionize the way you save!
